### Hi, I am now posting on LinkedIn for the first time. My goal is to post content that is:
1. Useful to those lacking a CS degree who are attempting to land entry level software engineering or related roles.
2. Talk about software engineering in general.

I hope my content is both enjoyable and helpful.

About Me:
I work in the software industry. I enjoy the unknown, figuring things out, coming up with various angles and approaches to tackle problems, root causing bugs, asking questions - I'm curious, data structures & algorithms - LeetCode, project work and delivering value, supporting product users, software design and architecture, and helping.

Some Technologies I've worked with: 
- Languages: JavaScript, Python, Swift, Objective-C, Java, HTML, CSS
- Libraries, Frameworks, and Tools: React, Node.js, Express, Helmet to secure applications, Flask, Django, SQL, noSQL - e.g. MongoDB Atlas, Peewee ORM, SQLAlchemy ORM, Mongoose ODM, EJS, Jinja2, Django Template Language, Jest, coverage.py, Python unit and integration testing, Heroku

Some of the industries I have experience in: Restaurant - Takeout and Delivery, Performance Management Software - OKRs, Conversations, Feedback, Recognition, Developer Infrastructure - IDE and Code Authoring tooling, Release Engineering

My content, thoughts, and views are entirely my own.
