### Hi, I am now posting on LinkedIn for the first time. My goal is to post content that is:
1. Useful to those lacking a CS degree who are attempting to land entry level software engineering or related roles.
2. Talk about software engineering in general.

I hope my content is both enjoyable and helpful.

About Me:
I work in the software industry. I enjoy the unknown, figuring things out, coming up with various angles and approaches to tackle problems, root causing bugs, asking questions (I'm curious), data structures & algorithms, project work and delivering value, supporting product users, software design and architecture, and helping.
