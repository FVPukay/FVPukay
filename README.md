### I am a Backend JavaScript Software Developer with 6.5 years experience working in the Bay Area. I currently work at Meta where I interact with more tools (extensions and web tools) than I can keep track of but the VS Code IDE, written in TypeScript, is my main focus. Before Meta, I worked at BetterWorks (startup) and Yelp.

### I enjoy using my software design and better engineering skills to contribute to the business model, the team, the org, and to the company's larger objectives. I am a problem solver by nature and enjoy helping and doing more than I am asked to. From time to time I also work outside of my specialization, for example, using React and working with the Frontend.
